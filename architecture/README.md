# wunder Identity Provider - wIP

`wunder Identity Provider` or `wIP` is Identity and Access Management System for all wunder Platform. The main goal of wIP is to streamline Access Control and to centralise Identity management across all wunder Platform products - wunderDB and any service developed going forward. 

`wunder Identity Provider` provides a platform for managing access simply by hooking new services with existing Identity and profile in the system.

The high-level architecture of `wIP` consists of two primary parts - Registration and Login. `wunder Identity Provider` does both `Authentication` - of new Accounts and `Authorization` - to End-Users and clients.

# Identity Specification

Identity Specification defines an User's Profile Speccification, uID, Tokens, etc. 

## Identity Structure

**Identifiers** - `email` (user provided) & `uID` (wIP Generated)

**Credentials** - `email` & `password` (SHA256 Hashed)

## Identity Units 

Identity Units are various information bits that are stored for each user. These are provided by the user.

`Email` , `Name` , `Password` 

## Authentication Units

These are various information, like - tokens and IDs that are uses for Authentication, Authorization and Access. These are generated by the system.

`uID` , `Admin Access Token` , `Core Service Configuration` ,  `Services Subscribed` , `Service Access Tokens`

## Complete Identity Structure

The following is a rough Identity Structure that will be implemented in wIP.

```
{
  "email" : <email> ,
  "user_uID" : <wIP Generated uID > ,
  "name" : <Name of User> ,
  "password" : <SHA-256 Hash of Password> ,
  "admin_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
  "services" : {
    "service_1" : {
      "service_ID" : < Same as uID> ,
      "service_name" : <Name of Service> ,
      "service_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
      "service_config" : <JSON describing a Initial Service Config, if any>
    },
    "service_2" : {
      "service_ID" : < Same as uID> ,
      "service_name" : <Name of Service> ,
      "service_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
      "service_config" : <JSON describing a Initial Service Config, if any>
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

Email is used as Primary Identifier for each user.  

```
{
  "email1@test.com" : {
    "email" : <email> ,
    "user_uID" : <wIP Generated uID > ,
    "name" : <Name of User> ,
    "password" : <SHA-256 Hash of Password> ,
    "admin_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
    "services" : {
      "service_1" : {
        "service_ID" : < Same as uID> ,
        "service_name" : <Name of Service> ,
        "service_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
        "service_config" : <JSON describing a Initial Service Config, if any>
      },
      "service_2" : {
        "service_ID" : < Same as uID> ,
        "service_name" : <Name of Service> ,
        "service_access_token" : <wIP Provisioned Token> ,
        "service_config" : <JSON describing a Initial Service Config, if any>
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  "email2@test.com" : {...},
  "email3@test.com" : {...},
  ...
}
```

# Access Tokens Framework

In the current wunderDB access-token system, we are using only one access token for all access - Admin Access, Service Access and App/Third-Party Client Access. This poses a serious fault that doesn't allow different levels of separation of access for different actions. The goal is to prepare a Multi-Token Multi-Level Access Token Framework for accessing different sections and actions in wPlat.

For use-case and intetion behind the Access Tokens Framework refer to [The Curious case of Login and the various Tokens](https://github.com/TanmoySG/wunder-identity-provider/blob/dev/architecture/notes.md#the-curious-case-of-login-and-the-various-tokens) in the Notes and Observations documenting the rough idea and intent behind the framework.

In this framework we'd be using three different Tokens - `Admin Access Token` , `Service Access Token` & `App Access Tokens`. The Use cases of each tokens are shown here -

# Registration

Registration consists of two phases - `Phase #1 - Authentication` & `Phase #2 - Authorization` 

### Phase #1 - Authentication 

User registration starts with Authentication-Key (OTP) generation. A new user is on-boarded by passing their Email to wIP. In response to the registration request, an `One-Time Password or OTP` is generated and sent to the user via e-mail. The Email address and other required data, in form of Payload is registered to the `AuthLib` - which stores all Verification Request details as `AuthLib Profiles`.

```
{
  "email" : <email of new user>
}
```

### Phase #2 - Authorization

Upon receiving the OTP, the user needs to send an `Authorization` Request with the OTP and other user information. The wIP recieves the request and the OTP and the Profile Information is cross-checked with `Auth Profiles`. Once the profile is successfully verified, an `uID` and `App Access Token` is generated by wIP and the User Information is registered as a Verified Profile in wIP and added to the wIP Profiles Storage.

```
{
  "email" : <email>,
  "otp" : <OTP>,
  ...
}
```

### AuthLib - a Secondary Authorization and Authentication storage

`AuthLib` serves as a secondary storage layer of information, required for Authentication and authorization. AuthLib helps in storing profiles while it is still un-verified , taking off load from the main Identity Profiles Storage, by providing an intermediate layer of storage. AuthLib is cleared off the payload and auth-profiles at regular intervals, upon expiry of the OTP, to save space and workload in the wIP system.
