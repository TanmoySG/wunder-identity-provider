# wunder Identity Provider v0.1

The wunder Identity Provider is the primary IAM - Identity and Access Management platform for all wunder Platform Products. The idea is to unify the identity and access across the board for more coherent and hassle-free single-point service and data access.

The wIP Architecture has several moving parts, but broadly can be consolidated for the end-user into two primary access/interaction points - `registration` and `login`. 

The Architectural and Design details are documented [here](./architecture/README.md).
